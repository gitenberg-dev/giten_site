== GITenberg Status Report #5

We're pleased to report that the GITenberg effort is helping https://www.gutenberg.org[Project Gutenberg] adopt some of the innovations piloted here. 

So far...

* The bugfixes we made to the PG EbookMaker software have migrated into the production https://github.com/guenbergtools/EbookMaker[EbookMaker software] on Project Gutenberg.
* Almost 200 problematic books identified in the GITenberg work are being rehabilitated on Project Gutenberg.
* The generated covers used for GITenberg were adapted for Project Gutenberg.
* Metadata processing software is being applied to generation of offline versions of Project Gutenberg.

The following are being seriously considered for implementation at Project Gutenberg (resources permitting) ...

* Use of Github for Project Gutenberg maintenance.
* YAML metadata for Project Gutenberg books.

If you have ideas for other ways to reuse the work done for this project, be sure to let us know!
